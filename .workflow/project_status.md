## 🎯 Current Status: Symptom Finder Triage V3 + Refine Chat Complete (3 Passes)
**As of Mar 3, 2026:** The **Symptom Finder** has been fully rebuilt as a production-grade Phase 1 feature. The triage flow is now strict 2-question → ResultsPanel handoff. A pure-TS scoring engine (`resources-scoring.ts`) ranks all resources before delivery. The `ResultsPanel` is a standalone component with live refine mini-chat, `PathwayModal`, Full Browse Mode, Sea Bag, and "Save All Recommended." Three passes were shipped and pushed to `main` in a single session.

### ✅ Recently Completed (Mar 3, 2026) — Symptom Finder Triage V3

**Pass 1 — Core Triage + Scoring Engine (commit `38beebf4`)**
- **`src/lib/resources-scoring.ts`** (NEW): Pure TS scoring engine — 5 factors (keyword relevance 50pts, veteran-centric 20pts, free/accessible 15pts, PA/Carlisle geo-bonus 10pts, static rating 5pts). Returns `Recommended`/`Good Match` badges, `matchPercent`, `whyMatches` ≤15 words, and `getSuggestedPathway()` for compound keyword pairs.
- **`src/app/health/components/symptom-finder/ResultsPanel.tsx`** (NEW): Standalone results component (`flex-1 overflow-auto`). Sticky VA | NGO | State tabs (7 resources each), card grid (title + badge + match% + desc + tags + `whyMatches` + "Visit Website →" + "Save to Sea Bag"), Full Browse Mode with Fitness | Peer | Grants | Yoga | Adaptive | Solo filters sorted by score, Sea Bag (`vet1stop_sea_bag` localStorage), Suggested Pathway banner (score >80 + compound keyword), Refine mini-chat `h-0` placeholder.
- **`SymptomFinderWizard.tsx`** (OVERWRITE): Layout `flex flex-col h-[calc(100vh-180px)]`. Triage flow collapsed to `idle → chat (2 questions) → results`. Chat shrinks to `h-16` minimized bar (`transition-all duration-300`) post-handoff. "Skip Chat & Generate My Resources" (patriotic yellow) reads `vet1stop_symptom_profile` localStorage fallback. Writes symptom profile after Q2.
- **`symptom-triage/route.ts`** (OVERWRITE): Model = `grok-4` (stipulated in system prompt). New `quick_triage` step asks exactly 2 questions in one reply. `CARLISLE_PA_CONTEXT = 'Carlisle, PA'` hardcoded (TODO Pass 2: dynamic). All AI resources scored via `resources-scoring.ts` before serialization. 7 pre-scored PA-specific static fallback resources per track. Zero 500 errors guaranteed.
- **Deleted 3 junk files** (Zero-Clutter Mandate): `route.ts.new`, `route.ts.fixed`, `route.new.ts`.

**Pass 2 — Refine Mini-Chat + Live Re-Scoring (commit `1483b15b`)**
- Always-visible slim blue trigger bar "Need better matches? Chat with Grok-4 →" expands to `384px` via CSS `maxHeight` transition.
- Chat bubbles matching `SymptomFinderWizard` style (SparklesIcon avatar, bounce typing indicator, error fallback).
- On send: `POST /api/health/symptom-triage` with `{ mode:'refine', step:'quick_triage', profile: localStorage(vet1stop_symptom_profile) }`.
- **Client-side keyword extraction** (`extractRefinementKeywords`): parses 20+ trigger terms from user message, appends new keywords to `liveKeywords` state — zero extra API dependency for re-scoring.
- **`rescoreWithKeywords()`**: calls `scoreAndSortResources` + `buildScoringContext` on all 3 tracks with updated keyword set. Merges scores back onto original recs → card grid re-renders live.
- "Match refreshed!" toast (fixed bottom-center, 2.8s auto-dismiss).
- 3 quick-send buttons: "More solo grants", "Show local Carlisle options", "Explain top match".
- `liveRecs` state replaces `result.recommendations` throughout so all UI elements reflect re-scored state.

**Pass 3 — Pathways Wired + Final Mobile Polish (commit `ff37f44e`)**
- **`PathwayModal` component**: In-page bottom-sheet (mobile) / centered modal (sm+). 4-step guide with step icon, body text in "Many veterans find this helps with motivation" language only. No clinical advice. Hardcoded steps for "Back Pain to Shape" + "Sleep & Recovery Track"; `DEFAULT_PATHWAY_STEPS` fallback for other labels. Closes on Escape or backdrop click.
- **`handleViewPathway`** now opens `PathwayModal(suggestedPathway)` — wired, not a no-op. TODO Pass 4: replace with `PathwayNavigator` context.
- **2 new refine quick-send buttons** (5 total): "Military-to-VA Transition Guide" and "Back Pain to Shape".
- **"Save All Recommended"** one-tap button: saves all `badge=Recommended` resources across all 3 tracks to Sea Bag in a single click. Only visible when ≥1 exists.
- **Mobile layout fix**: scrollable content area (`flex-1 overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain`) is now separate from refine panel. Refine panel is `flex-shrink-0` outside the scroll div — always anchored at bottom, never scrolled away. No card/refine overlap on mobile.
- **Tab bar**: `sticky top-0 bg-white/95` inside scroll area — stays visible while cards scroll.
- **SymptomFinderWizard**: `h-[calc(100dvh-180px)]` using dynamic viewport height for iOS Safari/Chrome mobile. `overflow-y-auto` on idle screen. Responsive message list heights. `overscroll-contain` prevents iOS scroll chaining.

### ✅ Previously Completed
* **Smart Bridge V2 + Symptom Finder Overhaul (Mar 2, 2026):**
  - **Receiver Page:** `src/app/health/symptom-finder/page.tsx` — bridge payload receiver with privacy wipe, Intel Brief banner, dev simulation tools.
  - **Wizard Overhaul:** Premium chat UI with gradient bubbles, AI/user avatars, timestamps, typing indicators, error retry toast, persistent "Not Medical Advice" disclaimer + 988 Crisis Line button.
  - **Auto-Trigger:** When bridge data is present, wizard skips welcome/category steps and opens with 2 clarifying questions pre-contextualized on extracted conditions.
  - **API Upgrade:** `symptom-triage/route.ts` upgraded to `grok-4` with resilient fallback to `grok-3-latest`. Bridge context injected into system prompt. Zero 500 errors.
  - **Clutter Cleanup:** Deleted 8 junk files (`.fixed`, `.new`, `.temp`, `.old`) from health directory.
  - **AI Command Center:** Created `.workflow/ai-command-center.md`.
* **Records Recon Production Polish + Smart Bridge V1 (Feb 28, 2026):** Massive 4-phase refactor moving Records Recon from functional to production-ready MVP. See detailed section below.
* **Records Recon v4.8 (Feb 23, 2026):** Three key improvements over v4.7:
  1. **VSO Briefing Pack PDF fix:** Download button now opens a print-ready preview in a new browser window and auto-triggers the print dialog. Users can "Save as PDF" natively from the browser print dialog instead of getting raw HTML code in VS Code.
  2. **Blue Button date extraction overhaul:** Fixed missing `may` month mapping (was completely absent). Added VA Blue Button-specific date formats: `DATE OF NOTE: FEB 06, 2024@14:48`, `ENTRY DATE`, `DATE ENTERED`, `DATE SIGNED`, `ADMISSION DATE`, `DISCHARGE DATE`, `Date entered`, `Date signed` — all with `@timestamp` support. Added standalone abbreviated month+timestamp pattern (`FEB 06, 2024@14:48`). Both `records-recon/route.ts` and `medical-detective/route.ts` updated.
  3. **UI/UX retheme to match site palette:** Replaced dark hacker theme (`#0A0F1A` bg, `#4ADE80` green accents) with the site's patriotic blue/gold/white palette (`#1A2C5B` primary, `#EAB308` gold accent, white backgrounds, `bg-blue-50` cards). All 6 sub-components updated: RecordsReconPanel, ReconDisclaimer, ReconTimeline, ConditionsIndex, ConditionFrequencyChart, BriefingPackExport.
* **Records Recon v4.7 (Feb 23, 2026):** Complete legal-safe refactor of "Medical Detective". Retired all claims advice language. New two-phase architecture: Phase 2a (Extraction) + Phase 2b (Structuring). Tabbed dashboard (Dashboard | Timeline | Conditions Index | Export), MVP PDF viewer split-pane with jump-to-page, VSO Briefing Pack export, and permanent legal disclaimer. See detailed section below.
* **Strategic Pivot:** Defined the "Living Master Strategy" (replacing the traditional business plan).
* **Revenue Model:** Finalized the "Hybrid Engine" (SaaS + B2B Spotlights + Gov Contracting).
* **Documentation:** Completed the **AI Command Center Cheat Sheet** for operational efficiency.
* **Vertical Expansion:** Formally integrated "Life & Leisure" (Space-A/Retreats) and "Education" (EdTech) into the core product pillars.
* **Grok API Key:** Configured server-side `GROK_API_KEY` in `.env.local` (was missing, causing both Symptom Finder and Medical Detective to silently fail).
* **Symptom Finder (Health Page):** Fully operational — conversational triage wizard uses `grok-4-latest` model, produces personalized VA/NGO/State resource recommendations with crisis detection.
* **Model Upgrades:** Updated all AI endpoints from older Grok models to `grok-4` (text/NLP via `XAI_API_KEY`) and `grok-2-vision-1212` (image analysis).

### 🚧 In Progress / Next Up
* ~~**Smart Bridge Receiver Node (Symptom Finder):**~~ ✅ **COMPLETE (Mar 2, 2026)**
* ~~**Symptom Finder Triage V3:**~~ ✅ **COMPLETE (Mar 3, 2026)** — 3 passes shipped. Scoring engine, ResultsPanel, refine chat, pathway modal, mobile polish. See above.
* **Symptom Finder end-to-end testing:** Test with real back pain + PTSD query, verify grok-4 API response shapes match scoring engine input, refine chat re-score flow, pathway banner trigger conditions.
* **Pass 4 — Pathway Navigator wiring:** Replace `PathwayModal` placeholder with real `PathwayNavigator` + `PathwayContext` integration. Add dynamic pathway slugs for "military-to-va-transition" and "adaptive-fitness-track".
* **Pass 4 — Dynamic user state:** Replace `CARLISLE_PA_CONTEXT` hardcode with Firebase Auth custom claim (`user.state`) + localStorage fallback. Add "Confirm your state?" single-ask in chat.
* **Records Recon thorough testing:** Needs real-world validation with VA Blue Button PDFs.
* **Local VOB Directory (Phase 1 next priority):** Leaflet map + real estate teaser. Section III.8 pathway cards already tease this.
* **Living Master Strategy alignment:** Verify `.workflow/master-strategy.md` matches living Google Doc.
* **Legal Setup:** LLC formation in PA (Pending).

### ✅ Records Recon v4.7 (Feb 23, 2026) — Legal-Safe Refactor Complete

**Why:** "Medical Detective" v4.3 contained legally dangerous language — claim types ("Primary Service-Connected", "Secondary", "PACT Act Presumptive"), next-action instructions ("File at va.gov", "Request nexus letter", "Submit buddy statement"), DC code references, rating estimates, and "Why This Matters for Your Claim" framing. These crossed red lines from VA OGC (38 CFR §14.629), FTC Operation AI Comply, and PA UTPCPL.

**What Changed:**
* **Retired "Medical Detective"** — renamed to **Records Recon** everywhere (API, UI, page.tsx, docs)
* **New API route:** `src/app/api/health/records-recon/route.ts` — completely rewritten
* **Two-phase architecture preserved, repurposed:**
  - Phase 1 (Smart Pre-Filter): Unchanged — `smartPreFilter()` works perfectly
  - Phase 2a (Extraction): Rewritten prompt — extracts conditions with page, date, section, provider, excerpt, category. **ZERO claim language.**
  - Phase 2b (Structuring): **Replaces** the old "claims analyst" call. Organizes raw extractions into `timeline[]`, `conditions_index[]`, `keyword_frequency[]`, `document_summary`. Pure reorganization — no advice.
* **Banned-words policy (softened):** Only claim/strategy words banned. Neutral document words allowed (excerpt, mention, found, referenced, page, section, etc.)
* **New UI:** Patriotic blue/gold/white theme matching site palette (`#1A2C5B` primary, `#EAB308` gold accent, white backgrounds)
  - Tabbed layout: Dashboard | Timeline | Conditions Index | Export
  - MVP PDF viewer: `<iframe>` split-pane with `#page=N` jump-to-page
  - Clickable page badges throughout — timeline entries, condition excerpts, all jump to PDF page
  - Permanent yellow disclaimer banner (non-dismissible)
  - Pre-scan consent checkbox required before "Run Recon" activates
  - Copy-to-clipboard on every excerpt
  - VSO Briefing Pack: opens print-ready preview → browser "Save as PDF" for professional document
* **Deleted (legal kills):**
  - `ANALYSIS_PROMPT` (the "VA disability claims analyst")
  - `generateInterimContext()` (contained claim filing instructions)
  - `addPactActCrossRef()` (implied eligibility determination)
  - All `claimType`, `nextAction`, `suggestedNextSteps`, `suggestedClaimCategory` fields
  - All UI text: "Why This Matters for Your Claim", "Recommended Next Step", "claim-relevant", "evidence flags"

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/api/health/records-recon/route.ts` — new legal-safe API (~900 lines)
- `src/app/health/components/RecordsReconPanel.tsx` — main tabbed panel + PDF viewer (~680 lines)
- `src/app/health/components/records-recon/ReconDisclaimer.tsx` — shared disclaimer banner
- `src/app/health/components/records-recon/ReconTimeline.tsx` — interactive vertical timeline
- `src/app/health/components/records-recon/ConditionFrequencyChart.tsx` — CSS bar chart
- `src/app/health/components/records-recon/ConditionsIndex.tsx` — searchable conditions table
- `src/app/health/components/records-recon/BriefingPackExport.tsx` — VSO Briefing Pack generator

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/health/page.tsx` — rebranded all "Medical Detective" → "Records Recon"

**Files Preserved (not deleted):**
- `src/app/api/health/medical-detective/route.ts` — kept for reference/rollback
- `src/app/health/components/MedicalDetectivePanel.tsx` — kept for reference/rollback

### ⚠️ Records Recon — Remaining Work
1. **Real-world testing** — Run the 1001-page Blue Button and mock PDFs through v4.8 to validate extraction quality, structuring accuracy, and **date extraction** from Blue Button entries.
2. **Excerpt quality** — Verify Grok-4 extracts real verbatim quotes, not hallucinated text.
3. **Timing targets** — Blue Button <75s, mock PDF <20s.
4. **PDF viewer edge cases** — Test iframe `#page=N` jump across Chrome, Edge, Firefox.
5. **Mobile responsiveness** — Test split-pane collapse on mobile (should stack vertically).
6. **Vercel deployment** — Verify serverless function timeouts work in production.
7. ~~**VSO Briefing Pack polish**~~ — ✅ Fixed in v4.8: now opens print-ready preview with auto-print dialog. Future: consider native PDF via `pdf-lib`.
8. ~~**Date extraction from Blue Button**~~ — ✅ Fixed in v4.8: added VA-specific date formats, fixed missing `may` month.

### 🔮 Records Recon — Future Sprint Roadmap

**Phase 1.5 — Enhanced PDF Viewer**
- Replace `<iframe>` with `react-pdf` + `pdfjs-dist` for virtualized rendering
- Page thumbnails sidebar, search within PDF
- Handles 1000+ page PDFs without browser memory issues

**Phase 2 — Premium Features**
- Stripe integration — premium gating, checkout, webhooks
- Multi-file merge — upload multiple records, merged timeline
- Advanced analytics — frequency trends over time, provider comparison
- Authentication gate — require login for premium tabs
- Custom filters — date range, category, provider filtering on timeline

**Phase 3 — Scale**
- Mobile-responsive command center optimization
- Native PDF generation via pdf-lib (replace HTML export)
- AI chatbot integration ("ask questions about your records")
- Rate limiting + usage tracking for freemium enforcement

### ✅ Medical Detective v4.2 (Feb 20, 2026) — Streaming Architecture Stable
* **Root cause fixed:** Switched from `response.json()` (hung forever) to streaming API (`stream: true`) with token-by-token receipt
* **Two-phase idle timeout:** 45s before first token (model thinking), 10s after (stall detection)
* **Auto-retry at 60% cap:** On first timeout, automatically reduces input and retries with 50s timeout
* **Interim report fallback:** On double timeout, immediately returns keyword flags + synopsis as interim report with green banner
* **Frontend UX:** Real-time token progress bar, green interim banner with "Retry Deep Analysis" button, PDF generation always enabled
* **Test results:** Mock PDF completes in ~63s with full streaming synthesis (1437 tokens received). No stall, no dead spinner.
* **Commit:** `Medical Detective v4.2 – reliable Grok-4 synthesis + interim UX fallback – Phase 1 ★ complete per master-strategy.md Section 2`

### 🚧 Medical Detective v4.3 (Feb 21, 2026) — Deep Evidence Synthesis (IN PROGRESS)
* **Fixed build crash:** Removed all image analysis code (`MODEL_VISION`, `screenImageWithVision`, `imageFiles`, `imagePromise`, `imageResults`) — duplicate `imageResults` declaration was causing webpack Module parse failure at line 1071. Image processing was not in Phase 1 spec.
* **Upgraded synthesis prompt:** Changed from loose numbered-list text format to **structured JSON array** output. Each flag now requests: condition, confidence, category, claimType (Primary/Secondary/PACT Act/Aggravated/Rating Increase), excerpt (verbatim 1-2 sentences), date, page, context (why it matters), nextAction (specific step).
* **Rewrote parser:** `parseSynthesisOutput` now tries JSON parse first (reliable structured output), falls back to numbered-list text parsing for backward compatibility.
* **Increased max_tokens:** 1500 → 3000 to give Grok-4 room for real excerpts and context instead of clipped summaries.
* **Added FlaggedItem fields:** `claimType` and `nextAction` added to both backend interface and frontend interface.
* **Frontend card expansion:** Each flag card now shows 3 distinct sections: "Highlighted Excerpt" (amber), "Why This Matters for Your Claim" (blue), "Recommended Next Step" (green). Plus claim type badge.
* **PDF report updated:** Includes claim type badge, highlighted excerpt, claim relevance, and next step per flag.
* **API key fix:** `getApiKey()` now checks both `XAI_API_KEY` and `GROK_API_KEY` env vars.
* **Safe controller.close():** Wrapped in try/catch to prevent `ERR_INVALID_STATE` crash on early returns.
* **Status: NOT COMPLETE** — Architecture is in place but output quality, timing, and edge cases have not been validated against real VA records. See "Remaining Work" list above.
* **Commits:** `d525aa99` (fix: 30s idle + API key + safe close + parser), `fdbc44ff` (v4.3: deep evidence synthesis + build fix)

### 📋 Session: Feb 20, 2026 — Medical Detective v4.x → v5.0 Planning

#### Root Cause (35% stall — FIXED)
`response.json()` hung indefinitely waiting for Grok-4 to complete the response body. Neither `AbortSignal.timeout` nor `setTimeout` bail-outs could interrupt the blocked `.json()` call.

#### Fix: Streaming SSE API (`stream: true`)
1. **New `callGrokAPIStreaming` function** — reads Grok-4 response token-by-token via Server-Sent Events
2. **Dual timeout protection** — 70s hard overall timeout + 10s idle timeout (no new token = bail)
3. **Auto-retry at 60% cap** — if first streaming call times out, automatically retries with 60% of input
4. **Interim report fallback** — if both attempts fail, returns keyword flags + green "Deep Analysis Paused" banner
5. **Real-time progress** — frontend shows token count during synthesis (every 15 tokens)
6. **Frontend UX** — "Phase 1: Live Flags" → "Phase 2: Deep Synthesis" labels, green interim banner, one-click retry with reduced cap

#### Files Changed
- `src/app/api/health/medical-detective/route.ts` — streaming synthesis, auto-retry, constants update
- `src/app/health/components/MedicalDetectivePanel.tsx` — phase labels, green interim banner, retry with reduced cap

#### Previous Commits (Feb 20)
- `515ffbc3` — v4.2 initial: AbortSignal.timeout + interim report + cached retry
- `5ce1f940` — v4.3: sorted input + section guarantee + setTimeout bail-out

---

### 📋 Session: Feb 19, 2026 — Medical Detective v3 "Three-Phase Pipeline"

#### Problem (v2 still too slow)
After v2 fix (adaptive chunks + parallel batches), a 1001-page VA Blue Button PDF still took 20-30+ minutes because:
- **28 Grok 4 API calls** at 60-120s each = too slow even with 3x parallelism
- **~75% of VA Blue Button content is administrative noise** (appointments, demographics, scheduling)
- Every chunk was sent to the expensive Grok 4 model regardless of content quality

#### v3 Architecture: Three-Phase Pipeline
**Phase 1 — Smart Pre-Filter (No AI, instant)**
- ~90 medical/claim keywords compiled into a single regex
- Scans every paragraph, discards non-medical content (appointments, demographics, immunizations, vitals)
- Reduces 1001-page VA Blue Button by ~75% → only high-signal paragraphs kept
- Result: 28 chunks → ~3-5 filtered chunks

**Phase 2 — Fast Screening with `grok-3-mini` (~20-30s)**
- Pre-filtered text sent to `grok-3-mini` (8-10x faster than Grok 4)
- Structured `FLAG|` output format for easy parsing
- Parallel batches of 3 with 60s timeout + 2 retries
- Live flags streamed to client as they're found

**Phase 3 — Grok 4 Synthesis (single call, ~30-45s)**
- All raw FLAG lines from Phase 2 sent to `grok-4-0709` in ONE call
- Grok 4 deduplicates, scores confidence, maps categories, writes nexus reasoning
- Fallback: if synthesis fails, screening flags used directly

#### Files Changed
- `src/app/api/health/medical-detective/route.ts` — complete rewrite to 3-phase pipeline
- `src/app/health/components/MedicalDetectivePanel.tsx` — phase indicators, live flags UI, updated event handling
- `next.config.js` — 50MB body size, pdf-parse external package (from v2)

#### Models Used
- **Screening**: `grok-3-mini` (fast, cheap)
- **Synthesis**: `grok-4-0709` (deep analysis, single call)
- **Vision**: `grok-3-mini` (for image uploads)

#### Performance Impact (estimated for 1001-page PDF)
| Metric | v1 (original) | v2 (adaptive chunks) | v3 (3-phase pipeline) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Chunks to process | ~72 | ~28 | ~3-5 |
| Model per chunk | Grok 4 (slow) | Grok 4 (slow) | grok-3-mini (fast) |
| Grok 4 calls | 72 | 28 | **1** (synthesis only) |
| Est. total time | Infinite (froze) | 20-30 min | **~45-75 seconds** |
| Live flag preview | No | No | Yes |
| Cancel button | No | Yes | Yes |

### � Today's Session Summary (Feb 18, 2026)

#### What We Accomplished
1. **Diagnosed Root Cause of AI Tool Failures**
   - Both Symptom Finder and Medical Detective were non-functional
   - `.env.local` was missing the server-side `GROK_API_KEY` (only client-side key existed, and it was old/expired)
   - Both API routes (`/api/health/symptom-triage` and `/api/health/medical-detective`) were silently returning empty/fallback responses

2. **Fixed API Key Configuration**
   - Added `GROK_API_KEY` (server-side) to `.env.local` with new xAI key: `xai-[REDACTED — store in .env.local only, never commit]`
   - Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_GROK_API_KEY` (client-side) to match

3. **Upgraded AI Models**
   - Symptom Finder: `grok-3-latest` → `grok-4-latest`
   - Medical Detective (NLP): `grok-3-latest` → `grok-4-latest`
   - Medical Detective (Vision): `grok-2-vision-latest` → `grok-2-vision-1206`

4. **Attempted PDF Parsing Library Upgrade (Reverted)**
   - Installed `pdf-parse` v2.4.5 for proper PDF text extraction
   - **Issue**: v2 uses ESM + `@napi-rs/canvas` native dependencies that broke Next.js webpack bundling
   - **Resolution**: Uninstalled `pdf-parse`, reverted to enhanced regex-based extraction

5. **Improved Medical Detective PDF Processing**
   - Enhanced regex extraction (BT/ET blocks + TJ arrays + UTF-8 fallback)
   - Added **Grok Vision API fallback** for scanned PDFs (when text extraction < 50 chars)
   - Added diagnostic logging throughout pipeline

6. **Verified API Connectivity**
   - Symptom Finder API test returned real Grok responses with personalized VA/NGO/State resources
   - Medical Detective compiles cleanly, route responds correctly

#### What Still Needs Work (Tomorrow's Focus)
**Symptom Finder Issues:**
- Not finding resources/recommendations **effectively** — conversation flows but result quality needs improvement
- Investigate: system prompt tuning, MongoDB resource DB integration, frontend wizard flow, assessment output quality

**Medical Detective Issues:**
- Not finding evidence flags **effectively** from real VA PDFs
- Investigate: regex extraction too weak for compressed/encoded VA PDFs (Blue Button exports), need proper PDF parsing library (`pdf-parse` v1.x or `pdfjs-dist` directly), test Grok Vision fallback with real records, tune AI prompts for VA-specific document formats

#### Files Modified Today
- `.env.local` — Added server-side key, updated both keys
- `src/app/api/health/symptom-triage/route.ts` — Model upgrade + error logging
- `src/app/api/health/medical-detective/route.ts` — Model upgrades, PDF extraction rewrite, Vision fallback
- `.workflow/project_status.md` — Updated status & timeline (this file)

## 3. What's NOT Built Yet (Incomplete / Planned)

### Pages Not Yet Implemented
| Page | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Life & Leisure** | ❌ Not built | Has route planned but no page component |
| **Local** | ❌ Not built | Map-based veteran business directory — needs Google Maps API |
| **Shop** | ❌ Not built | E-commerce marketplace — needs payment processing (Stripe) |
| **Social** | ❌ Not built | Veteran social network with events, groups, messaging |
| **Contact** | ❌ Not built | Basic contact form |

### Features Not Yet Implemented
- **Life & Leisure page** following the Health page pattern
- **Local page**: Map integration, business directory, verification, ratings
- **Shop page**: Product catalog, seller onboarding, cart/checkout, order management
- **Social page**: Profiles, forums, events, groups, messaging, content moderation
- **Premium feature gates**: Visual indicators, pricing page, subscription management
- **Payment processing**: Stripe/PayPal integration
- **Military verification**: ID.me or equivalent
- **Advanced search**: Cross-page unified resource search
- **Resource rating/feedback system**
- **User profile management page**
- **Protected routes middleware** (auth guards)
- **SEO optimization** (metadata on layout is commented out due to client component)
- **Vercel deployment** (was attempted but had issues; currently local-only)
- **Mobile app** (React Native — long-term)
- **Comprehensive testing** (only basic tests exist)

---

## 4. Known Technical Issues

1. **Layout metadata**: `src/app/layout.tsx` is marked `"use client"` which prevents Next.js metadata export. Metadata is commented out. Needs refactoring to separate server/client concerns.
2. **Peer dependency warnings**: `@tanstack/react-query@4.x` has peer dep conflicts with React 19. Works but shows warnings.
3. **Duplicate hook files**: Both `useAuth.ts` and `useAuth.tsx` exist — should consolidate.
4. ~~**`.fixed` and `.new` files scattered**~~ — ✅ **Resolved (Mar 3, 2026)**: All flagged junk files in the health/API directories deleted. `_backup/` folder and any `ngo-data.ts.fixed` variants in `src/utils/` may still exist — verify and clean if present.
5. **Health page complexity**: 84 files in the health directory; some may be redundant (`simplified-page.tsx`, `page.tsx.new`).
6. **Vercel deployment**: Previously had issues with large files and build errors. Not currently deployed.
7. **Testing gaps**: Most tests are pending; only basic component import tests pass.

## 8. Where We're Going — Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 1 Health MVP Completion)
1. **Symptom Finder E2E test** — Run real back pain + PTSD query through full stack: bridge handoff → 2-question triage → grok-4 assess → scored ResultsPanel → refine "more yoga" → PathwayModal click. Verify all localStorage keys write/read correctly.
2. **Pass 4 — Dynamic state + PathwayNavigator wiring** — Replace `CARLISLE_PA_CONTEXT` with user profile state. Wire `handleViewPathway` to existing `/health/pathways/[id]` + `PathwayContext`.
3. **Local VOB Directory MVP** — Phase 1 next priority per master-strategy Section III. Leaflet map, real estate teaser, RESPA disclaimers.
4. **Fix the layout.tsx server/client split** — Restore SEO metadata.
5. **Get Vercel deployment working** — Critical for investor demos.

### Short-Term (Complete MVP)
6. **PCS Commander + Smart Bridge integration** — Phase 1 priority #3 per master-strategy.
7. **Auto-Fill shared component** — Phase 1 priority #4, "not official VA claims assistance" disclaimer required.
8. **Build Life & Leisure page** — Follow Health/Education pattern.
9. **Implement premium feature indicators** — Visual gates showing future paid features.
10. **Create pricing page** — Clean tier comparison.

### Medium-Term (Post-MVP / Post-Funding)
11. **Build Local page** — Map-based veteran business directory (Leaflet + real Google Places API).
12. **Build Shop page** — Product catalog, seller onboarding, Stripe.
13. **Build Social page** — Basic community features (events, groups).
14. **Payment processing** (Stripe).
15. **Military verification** (ID.me).
16. **Mobile app** (React Native — long-term).
