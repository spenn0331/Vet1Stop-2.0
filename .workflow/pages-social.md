## Purpose & Goals

1. Create a safe, supportive online community exclusively for veterans and their families
2. Facilitate connections between veterans based on shared service experiences, interests, or geographic proximity
3. Provide a centralized hub for veteran-focused events, meetups, and activities
4. Enable veterans to share resources, advice, and support with peers who understand their unique experiences
5. Foster mentorship relationships between veterans at different stages of their military and civilian journeys

## Target User Scenarios

A recently discharged veteran looking to connect with others who understand the transition experience and can provide guidance and community.

### Scenario 2: Relocated Veteran
A veteran who has moved to a new area and is seeking to build a local support network and find veteran-friendly activities.

### Scenario 3: Veteran Seeking Peer Support
A veteran dealing with service-related challenges who wants to connect with others who have similar experiences in a supportive environment.

### Scenario 4: Veteran Mentor
A veteran who has successfully navigated civilian life and wants to help guide and support other veterans through their journeys.
