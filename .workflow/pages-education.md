# Education Page Blueprint

## Purpose & Goals
The Education page serves as a comprehensive hub for veterans seeking educational opportunities, benefits, and resources. Its primary goals are to:

1. Provide clear, organized access to all education benefits veterans are entitled to
2. Connect veterans with educational institutions that offer veteran-specific programs
3. Guide veterans through the process of choosing, applying for, and succeeding in educational programs
4. Inform veterans about alternative education paths such as vocational training, certifications, and online learning
5. Showcase success stories of veterans who have successfully leveraged their education benefits

## Target User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Recent Discharge

### Scenario 2: Mid-Career Transition
A veteran who has been in the civilian workforce for several years but wants to upskill or change careers through additional education.

### Scenario 3: Vocational Interest
A veteran interested in skilled trades or vocational training rather than traditional college degrees.

### Scenario 4: Family Benefits
