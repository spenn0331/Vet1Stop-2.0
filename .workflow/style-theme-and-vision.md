## Spatial Design System

### Grid and Layout Philosophy

Our spatial design system is built around concepts of order, structure, and purposeful allocation of resources:

1. **12-Column Precision**
   - Flexible grid system that adapts across viewports while maintaining proportional relationships
   - Deliberate column usage that creates rhythm and predictability
   - Spatial allocation that prioritizes the most important resources and actions

2. **Breathing Room Protocol**
   - Consistent spacing scale based on 8px increments (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
   - Generous whitespace that reduces cognitive load and creates focus
   - Padding and margins applied consistently to establish visual order

3. **Strategic Density**
   - Information density carefully calibrated to balance comprehensive content with clarity
   - Progressive disclosure patterns to manage complex information
   - Resource cards sized to provide adequate information without overwhelming

### Component Elevation Strategy

Our approach to visual hierarchy through elevation creates a sense of order and organization:

1. **Elevation Levels**
   - Level 0: Flat elements (backgrounds, disabled elements)
   - Level 1: Slightly raised (cards, buttons, form fields)
   - Level 2: Moderately raised (dropdown menus, popovers)
   - Level 3: Highly raised (modals, dialogs)
   - Level 4: Maximum elevation (critical notifications, onboarding)

2. **Shadow Application**
   - Consistent light source (top-left) across all shadows
   - Shadow intensity and blur related directly to elevation level
   - Subtle shadows that suggest depth without creating visual noise

3. **Z-index Management**
   - Systematic z-index scale that prevents conflicts
   - Semantic z-index naming related to element purpose, not arbitrary numbers
   - Documentation of z-index usage to maintain consistency during development

## Motion and Interaction Design

### Motion Philosophy

Our motion design strategy emphasizes clarity, purpose, and respect for user attention:

1. **Purposeful Animation**
   - Every animation serves a functional purpose (direction, feedback, attention)
   - No animation exists purely for decoration or entertainment
   - Motion design that helps users understand state changes and system responses

2. **Measured and Dignified**
   - Animation timing curves that feel natural but efficient (ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits)
   - Duration calibrated to the size and importance of the element (150ms-300ms standard range)
   - Subtle transitions that respect users' time and attention

3. **Accessibility First**
   - All animations can be disabled for users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity
   - Critical information never conveyed through motion alone
   - Reduced motion alternatives for all animated interactions

### Interaction States

Clear and consistent interaction states provide users with confidence and predictability:

1. **Button and Control States**
   - Default: Solid, visible, and clearly interactive
   - Hover: Subtle brightness increase (5-10%) with cursor change
   - Focus: Prominent focus ring in complementary color (accessible)
   - Active/Pressed: Slight size reduction (2-3%) and darkening to simulate physical press
   - Disabled: Reduced opacity (60%) and desaturated colors

2. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Immediate visual feedback for all user actions
   - Loading states that communicate progress clearly
   - Success and error states with both color and icon indicators
   - Consistent toast notification system for system messages

## Imagery and Iconography Strategy
