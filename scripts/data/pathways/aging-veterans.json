You may qualify if:\n- You have a single permanent disability rated at 100% AND\n- You are substantially confined to your immediate premises because of your disability\n\n*Note: You cannot receive both Aid & Attendance and Housebound benefits at the same time.*\n\n## Application Process\n\n1. **Gather Documentation**:\n   - DD214 or separation papers\n   - Medical evidence of need for A&A (preferably VA Form 21-2680)\n   - Income and net worth information\n   - Information about healthcare expenses\n\n2. **Submit Application**:\n   - VA Form 21-527EZ for veterans\n   - Submit to closest VA regional office\n   - Consider working with a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) for free assistance\n\n3. **Medical Evaluation**:\n   - May need an examination to confirm need for regular aid and attendance\n\n## Financial Impact\n\n- Basic pension amount varies based on income, dependents, and need level\n- A&A and Housebound increase the maximum pension amount\n- Unreimbursed medical expenses may reduce countable income, increasing benefit\n- Pays the difference between countable income and the annual pension limit\n\n## Planning Considerations\n\n- Asset transfers may affect eligibility (look-back period of 36 months)\n- Work with an accredited representative before making financial decisions\n- Review potential impact on other benefits like Medicaid\n\nContact your local Veterans Service Organization (VFW, American Legion, DAV) for free assistance with applying for these benefits.",
