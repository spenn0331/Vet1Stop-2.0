# Your rule content

- Always confer with the .workflow directory for intention, guidelines, and goals
- Do not duplicate files
- Always automatically commit changes to the repository at least once every 3 hours of active work to ensure progress is saved
- Regularly update the .workflow directory files to reflect current project status, progress, and evolving goals
- When implementing new features or making significant changes, update relevant .workflow files such as sprint-planning.md, feature-prioritization.md, and metrics-success-criteria.md to track progress
- Maintain documentation of completed work, ongoing tasks, and future plans in the .workflow directory to ensure alignment with project goals
- Refactor code to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability
## Project Overview
- Always confer with the .workflow directory for intention, guidelines, and goals
- Vet1Stop is being rewritten as a Next.js application following comprehensive blueprint documents in the `.workflow/nextjs-blueprint/` directory
- The goal is to create a polished MVP for investor pitching while documenting future enhancements
- Target users: U.S. veterans seeking resources (primary) and general public discovering veteran businesses (secondary)
- All implementation should follow the technical specifications in the blueprint files

## Coding Standards
- Use Next.js 14+ with App Router architecture following best practices
- Implement Tailwind CSS for styling with proper configuration through postcss
- Create responsive, mobile-first designs that follow the design specifications
- Write TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Implement Firebase authentication for user management
- Use MongoDB Atlas for resource data storage
- Structure the codebase following the architecture outlined in technical-architecture.md
- Include comprehensive comments and documentation in the code

## Implementation Guidelines
- Generate complete, production-ready code rather than simplified examples
- Explain all technical concepts in beginner-friendly language
- Provide file paths and detailed implementation instructions with each code block
- Configure proper error handling, loading states, and fallback UI
- Write clean, maintainable React components following atomic design principles
- Implement proper SEO with Next.js metadata API
- Set up environment variables and configuration files as needed
- Create comprehensive test files for critical components

## Feature Implementation Priority
1. Project setup with all required dependencies
2. Homepage with navigation, hero section, and resource categories
3. Education page with resource display system
4. Firebase authentication integration
5. MongoDB resource data integration
6. Remaining pages (Health, Life and Leisure, Jobs, Shop, Social, Local)
7. Admin dashboard implementation

## Technical Requirements
- Implement server components and client components appropriately
- Use React Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Implement the resource display system using Grid Cards as specified
- Configure proper image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Set up API routes for resource data using Next.js API Routes
- Create reusable hooks for common functionality (authentication, data fetching)
- Implement proper state management with React Context or similar
- Configure proper caching strategy for resource data
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals and performance

## Resource System
- Implement the resource display system exactly as specified in resource-display-system.md
- Create dynamic filtering and search functionality for resources
- Implement proper pagination and loading states
- Include sorting options by relevance, date, and popularity
- Create resource detail pages with comprehensive information
- Distinguish between free and premium resources (visual indicators only for MVP)

## Authentication
- Follow the Firebase integration blueprint exactly
- Implement sign-up, sign-in, and password reset flows
- Create protected routes for authenticated content
- Include social authentication options as specified
- Store user preferences and profiles in Firebase
- Prepare for military verification (placeholder UI only for MVP)

## Deployment
- Configure the application for Vercel deployment
- Set up proper environment variables for different environments
- Implement the CI/CD process as outlined in ci-cd-blueprint.md
- Create production build optimization configurations
- Include proper error monitoring and logging

## Best Practices
- Write code comments for clarity, especially for complex logic
- Test changes incrementally, starting with small updates
- Reference the blueprint documents frequently to ensure alignment
- Prioritize accessibility, performance, and scalability
- Use responsive design patterns that work across all device sizes
- Create fallback mechanisms for when external services fail
- Follow security best practices for authentication and data storage
